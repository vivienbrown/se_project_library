                <p class="card__text">
                  An inspiring 5 book series featuring a trilogy, prequel and
                  sequel set in a Japanese feudal era with the added themes of
                  fantasy, magic and mystery. The story follows Otori Takeo in
                  his journey of self-discovery, love, and war. Otori Takeo was
                  rescued and trained as a warrior by Otori Shigeru. Takeo falls
                  in love with a princess while at the capital city, but must
                  escape a group with special powers claiming him. When Takeo
                  returns, Shigeru is gone and the country is controlled by
                  another army. Takeo must navigate conflicting obligations and
                  make choices that drive the story throughout the trilogy while
                  also reconciling the conflicting spiritual beliefs and
                  influences that he has experienced throughout his life.

                  The author writes about her experience of living with
                  Aspergers Syndrome. Davide-Rivera talks about events in her
                  life, knowing she was different but was often characterized as
                  stubborn, lazy or difficult rather than needing accommodation,
                  and explains how being undiagnosed affected her. The end of
                  the book discusses the change in the diagnosis of Aspergers,
                  now re-classified under the umbrella of the Autism spectrum.
                  As an aside, this is a good thing due to the history of Dr.
                  Asperger who worked for Nazi Germany in identifying which
                  Autistic people would be "useful" to the regime.

                  "The Mists of Avalon" is a book about the stories of King
                  Arthur, but told from the point of view of the women. The main
                  character is Morgaine, who is usually portrayed as a wicked
                  sorceress, but in this book, she is shown as a determined and
                  faithful woman who works to protect and uphold her religion
                  against the encroachment of a rigid new faith from Rome that
                  considers her ways a sin.

              At this event, which celebrates the library's namesake, our guest
              lecturer will take us on a journey exploring some of the most
              prominent female researchers in the world of space science. It's
              easy to buy into the misconception that this field was mostly
              dominated by men, but our lecture aims to change that notion and
              prove that this hasn't been the case since at least the 18th
              century.

              Libraries are essential establishments in practically every city,
              and Practicum's library is no exception. It first opened its doors
              way back in 2018, right as our humble town began bidding welcome
              to its very first citizens!
            </p>
            <p class="about__paragraph">
              Since its initial opening, the library has seen nearly 342
              visitors each month. That's almost 50% of our population! So far,
              most citizens have enjoyed reading books and making use of our
              ample online resources.
            </p>
            <p class="about__paragraph:nth-child(3)">
              The library gets its name from Joan Feynman, an American
              astrophysicist and the first woman to be elected as an officer of
              the American Geophysical Union.
